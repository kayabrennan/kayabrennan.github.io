<p>‘The past is present. Something has happened and the echoes are still resonating in my head.’ -- Ian Farr, Memory (2012)</p>
<p>There is a perceptual flow of human consciousness in relation to memory. A split second recalls the past while anticipating the future, all consuming of the present moment. This series of work is an intuitive response to the ephemeral nature of the mind. Contemplating the instant as influenced by experience.</p>
